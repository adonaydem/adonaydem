Okay — I'm obsessed with computer vision: diffusion and generative models, and there applications in medical imaging.

**What I do**
- Research + production: take models from prototype to endpoint.
- Agents & multi-agent systems, long-range graph and chain reasoning.
- Backend engineering (FastAPI, Flask) and scalable infra.

**Experience**
- Two internships: Computer Vision & AI & Backend.
- Many projects, multiple wins in competitions and demos.

**Core stack**
Python · JavaScript · PyTorch · LangChain · FastAPI · Flask · MongoDB · PostgreSQL · AWS · React · HuggingFace
